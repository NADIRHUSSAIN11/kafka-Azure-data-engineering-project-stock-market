This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time stock data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka, Azure Data Lake Gen2, and Azure Synapse Analytics. The pipeline is designed to produce, consume, and process stock data in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- Apache Kafka
- Azure Data Lake Gen2
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Python
- Pandas
- Azure Blob Storage

## Project Overview

1. **Producing Real-Time Stock Data**: Stock data is produced using Python libraries for JSON, Apache Kafka, and Pandas.



2. **Consuming Data with Apache Kafka**: Apache Kafka is hosted on an Azure Virtual Machine (Ubuntu) to consume the real-time stock data.

3. **Loading Data into Azure Data Lake Gen2**: Consumed data is loaded into Azure Data Lake Gen2 using Python libraries for Azure Blob Storage.

4. **Real-Time Data Processing with Azure Synapse Analytics**: The data is queried and formatted in real-time using Azure Synapse Analytics.
